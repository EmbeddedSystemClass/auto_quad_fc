Note: IF YOU ARE USING EWARM v6.20 OR LATER, IT'S REQUIRED TO COMPILE LATEST 
      CMSIS LIBRARY RATHER THEN THE ONE INSTALLED WITH THE PACKAGE.
      TO DO SO, IT'S REQUIRED TO CHANGE OPTIONS OF BOTH USER PROJECT AND MC 
      APPLICATION THIS WAY:
      - IN GENERAL OPTIONS, LIBRARY CONFIGURATION TAB, CHECK 'Use CMSIS LIBRARY'
      - IN C/C++ COMPILER, PREPROCESSOR TAB, DELETE ADDITIONAL INCLUDE DIRECTORY
        $PROJ_DIR$\..\..\Libraries\CMSIS\CoreSupport
